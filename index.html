    <h2>Why You Should Give Me a 4/4 For This Assignment?</h2>

    <p>
      This assignment implement a icosphere mesh generation algorithm with mesh
      subdivision. Some articles online (like
      <a
        href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2021/03/27/generating-spheres.html"
        >this one</a
      >) talked about some implementation detail. BUT, most articles focused on
      generating mesh instead of texture coordinate generation.
    </p>

    <p>
      To generate a icosphere mesh with possible texture coordinate mapped to a
      real world map. A lot of other things need to be done. The most important
      one is guaranteeing that there's no mesh go across the poles. Since it
      will be difficult to map the texture to the mesh at poles.
    </p>

    <p>
      To generate texture coordinates for the mesh, I calculate the longitude
      and latitude of each vertex. But this makes the texture mapping near the
      International Date Line not correct. Some extra work is done

      to make everything looks good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, this assignment implement a specular map to make the land looks
      more rough and water looks more shiny. The framework actually supports
      more texture maps if you want.

    <h2>EDITOR INSTRUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      You MAY NOT BE ABLE TO directly open White Dwarf Editor below without
      hosting any server. Since the shader source code and texture are loaded
      from the local file system. To open a world file, you need to download the
      world files from the link below and open it in the editor.
    </p>

    <p>
      HOWEVER, YOU CAN ACCESS THE ONLINE EDITOR:
      <a
        href="https://fangjun-zhou.github.io/cs559-webgl-texture/dist/editor.html"
        >HERE</a
      >!!!
    </p>

    <p>
      1. Download <a href="dist/world.json">world.json</a>. <br />
      2. Open the downloaded file in the editor. <br />
      3. Right click to rotate views. Use scroll wheel to zoom in and out. Use
      middle click to move camera. <br />
      4. Change the mode on the top right corner from "move" to "view", now you
      can use left click to move the camera. 5. Change the mode to "rotate", now
      you can drag the handles to rotate the selected entity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mesh Subdivision Usage: <br />
      1. Create a new entity. <br />
      2. Add TransformData3D, IcosphereMeshGeneratorData, and MeshRenderData3D
      to the entity. <br />
      3. Change the flatNormal field to true for flattened normals. <br />
      4. Change the subdivision field to the number of subdivisions. <br />
      5. Change the radius field to the radius of the sphere. <br />
      6. You may not change the subdivision number too large. Set to 3 or 4 is
      recommended. <br />
    </p>

    <h2>RELEASE INSTRUCTION</h2>
    <p>
      The following release versions need file permission. So you may not be
      able to access it locally. You can host a server via VSCode Live Server or
      Python http server. OR YOU CAN ACCESS THE ONLINE VERSION
      <a

        >HERE</a
      >!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Use left click to move camera.<br />
      Right click to rotate views. <br />
      Use scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
